* node consumes A LOT of memory ! Microservices and stuff
  * should not be written in js if possible
  * should be reused in "waiting" state if possible (ok with fibers but currently a service is expected to handle only 1 cn at a time)
* update tests for the project
* outputs with keys (not only indices)
